These topics are covered in Chapters 7, 8, and 10 of [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). You should already have read these chapters and worked through those notebooks. If you haven't done that, stop reading this notebook and complete those instead. It will also be useful to understand how to open and read files. This is discussed in Chapter 14 of the book, but is also covered in this notebook, before we proceed to the assignment itself. "
