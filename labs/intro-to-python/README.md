#### GISC 420 T1 2021
# Introduction to Python basics
This week we have four instruction sets to explore. One of them is this one, so three more to go.

+ [Arithmetic, values and types](00-arithmetic-values-and-types.md)
+ [Variables, expressions and statements](01-variables-expressions-and-statements.md)
+ [Turtles all the way down](02-turtles.md)

You should work through these in order in class, to begin to get a feel for Python code, what it looks like, and some basic aspects of its behaviour. You should do this in the IDLE program, starting it from the course Python environment, per the [instructions here](../README.md#week-1)

Throughout these instructions where you see content in `code` format like this:
```
this is code format
```

You should type it at the IDLE prompt and see what happens.

It is also generally a good idea to work through material in the _Think Python_ book in this way. It's a much better way to learn than just reading.

You will find similar material to these sets of instructions in Chapters 2 and 4 of [*Think Python: How to think like a Computer Scientist*](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf), and I would encourage you to also work through those materials after this class to reinforce the ideas. Even if you have done a little programming before&mdash;*and even if it was in Python*&mdash;I find that it is useful to do this kind of work---you often find out things you didn't know! (I know I did.)
